- 👋 Hi, I’m @MartinSchvartz, currently I'm studying systems engineering at UTN and doing some silly projects with the propouse of learning new things that catch my attention
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile/web development, mostly with react/react-native but is always fun to learn a new technology and see what can be done with it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about back-end with Node.js and how it works. In my career i did some subjects that allow me to understand better how things work. For example the subject Operating Systems helped me understand concepts like web sockets, http request, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects that will make me learn new things and face new challenges
- 💻 Most of my personal projects carried out with the aim of learning something new can be found here in my repos
